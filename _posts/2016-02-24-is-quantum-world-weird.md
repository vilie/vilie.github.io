title: Is quantum physics weird?
tags: quantum phyisics

As our species evolved, our intuition evolved to accommodate the nature around
us, relative to our own scale. We needed to hunt more efficiently, so we build
bows. We tried to guess the path of a rock thrown when hunting an animal,
and later we built mathematical models to describe its full trajectory. We
figured out that by using a movable pulley we can cut in half the force needed
to lift a very heavy rock while building a temple.

Did we ever encountered things that are much smaller or bigger than us? What
about things that are a lot faster, or more energetic? So we might find it 
weird and absurd when we hear notions like "time dilation", "wave-particle
duality" or "the maximum speed in the universe". We are good at throwing spears
at people from another tribe, but we never had to throw electrons at them.

Quantum mechanics is not weird, our intuition is weird. Our expectation that the
small particles should act like our everyday rocks cannot be condemned, but can
be educated.
